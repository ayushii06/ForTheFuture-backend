# How we built it

**Frontend:** Built using **React** for dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The interactive visualizations are powered by **D3.js and Chart.js.**

**Backend:** Developed with **Node.js and Express.js** to handle API requests, user authentication, and data management. **MongoDB** is used for storing user data, posts, comments, and likes.

**APIs and Data Sources:** Integrated with various **climate data APIs** to fetch real-time data. The backend also includes endpoints for fetching and processing this data.

**Authentication:** Implemented **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.

**Community Features:** Created endpoints for posts, comments, and likes, with real-time updates using WebSockets.

# Challenges we ran into

**Data Integration:** Integrating real-time data from multiple sources while ensuring accuracy and consistency was a major challenge.

**Scalability:** Designing the architecture to handle a large number of users and real-time data updates efficiently.
